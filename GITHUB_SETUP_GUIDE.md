# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

This guide will help you complete the setup of your TBI Lesion Analysis Pipeline repository on GitHub.

## ✅ Step 1: Repository is Live

Your repository is now live at: [https://github.com/thildebrant/tbi](https://github.com/thildebrant/tbi)

## 📝 Step 2: Add Repository Topics

### Option A: Manual Setup (Recommended)
1. Go to your repository: [https://github.com/thildebrant/tbi](https://github.com/thildebrant/tbi)
2. Click on the **gear icon** (⚙️) next to "About" section
3. In the "Topics" field, add these topics (comma-separated):
   ```
   medical-imaging, mri-analysis, tbi, deep-learning, brain-segmentation, neuroscience, python, pytorch, monai, medical-ai, neuroimaging, brain-injury, segmentation, 3d-imaging
   ```
4. Click **Save changes**

### Option B: Using GitHub API (Advanced)
If you have a GitHub Personal Access Token:
```bash
# Set your token
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_token_here"

# Run the setup script
python3 setup_repository.py
```
